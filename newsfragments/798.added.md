Support overriding the default `imagePullPolicy` for every component by setting `image.pullPolicy`.

Per-image overrides can be set by setting `<path.to>.image.pullPolicy` as before.

If `image.pullPolicy` or per-image overrides aren't set `IfNotPresent` is used by default for images
referenced by digest and `Always` is used by default images referenced by tag as previously.
