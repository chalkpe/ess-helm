Upgrade Synapse to v1.139.2.

Highlights:
* Fix [`CVE-2025-61672`](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61672) / [`GHSA-fh66-fcv5-jjfr`](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-fh66-fcv5-jjfr). Lack of validation for device keys in Synapse before 1.139.1 allows an attacker registered on the victim homeserver to degrade federation functionality, unpredictably breaking outbound federation to other homeservers.
